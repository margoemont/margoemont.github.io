## Highlights

{% capture text %}

My research spans a number of topics regarding adipose tissue and adipocyte development and function. My PhD work focused on elucidating the control of thermogenesis in beige adipocytes, while my more recent work involves using new technologies such as single nuclear RNA sequencing to study adipose tissue heterogeniety.
