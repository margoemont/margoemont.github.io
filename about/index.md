I am an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and in the lab of Evan Rosen at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. I completed my PhD in the lab of Jun Wu at the University of Michigan where I studied the regulation of thermogenic adipocytes. My current work uses single nuclear RNA sequencing to study the heterogeneity of cell types in white adipose tissue and how cell type proportion and function are affected under different physiological conditions. In my free time, I enjoy knitting and crocheting, trying new resturants, and hanging out with my cat, Dr. Franklin.

### _Grants and Fellowships_

**Past**

| Year(s) | Grant title | Funding Agency, Grant type and Grant number | Official role on project | Description of major goals|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2016-2017 | Regulation of Thermogenesis in Adipocytes Through TRPA1 | NIH F31 DK112625 | Role: PI | This project seeks to characterize the role that heat-sensing cation channel TRPA1 plays in the regulation of the thermogenic program in beige adipocytes. |
| 2020-2022 | Investigating the Regulation of IRF4 in Adipocytes | NIH F32 DK124914 | Role: PI | This project seeks to define the regulation of the transcription factor IRF4 in adipocytes under a variety of physiological stimulations, as well as to gain a more complete understanding of the transcriptional program controlled by IRF4 once activated. |

**Current**

| Year(s) | Grant title | Funding Agency, Grant type and Grant number | Official role on project | Description of major goals|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022- present | Investigating the Regulation of Distinct Human Adipocyte Subpopulations | NIH K01 DK134806| Role: PI | This project seeks to further interrogate distinct subtypes of white adipocytes, first identified in our lab, by discovering the stimuli that predispose one subpopulation over another and ultimately create _in vitro_ models of these subpopulations for further study.|
